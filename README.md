# The Pokemon Game (OOP)
In the Pokemon game you have to manage a group of agents whose goal is to catch as many Pokemon as possible before time runs out. 
The more Pokemon you catch, the more points you earn. 
The game is played on a game board
Varies, depending on the stage you choose to play (there are 24 different stages, with increasing difficulty.) 
The movement on the board is on a weighted directed graph, on which Pokemon are randomly scattered, the same
Agents can catch by moving close to them on the graph.
